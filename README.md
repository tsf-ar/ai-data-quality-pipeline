Project Title



AI Data Cleaning, Validation \& QA Pipeline (Python)



Overview



This project demonstrates an end-to-end AI data preparation pipeline using Python and Pandas. It focuses on multilingual and RTL text (Arabic and Urdu), covering data cleaning, validation, and quality assurance before data is used for AI annotation or model training.



Key Capabilities



Load and inspect CSV and JSON datasets



Clean multilingual text safely (punctuation removal, whitespace normalization)



Validate annotation labels



Apply data quality rules (short text, duplicates, language mismatch)



Generate cleaned datasets and QA reports



Run the entire pipeline from the command line
